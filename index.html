  The Question paper automation is developed to replace the manual setting of the question paper and automate the whole process of getting different unique questions from teachers and generate a randomized, fast and secure question paper.<br>
  The website will allow the respective IC to set the question paper pattern for the course and the IC and teachers are allowed to input their questions according to the question paper pattern set by the IC (assuming the question inputs to be different from different teachers and IC). Viewing and editing of the questions by the HOD, IC and teachers. Finally, automatic question paper generation by the questions that was taken as an input.<br>

The question paper pattern is set by the IC, therefore questions can be taken as input only if the IC sets the question paper pattern, hence dependency for taking questions as input. Assuming the profile of the users to be with us.</p>
